# Orbbec SDK Wrappers

## Introduction

  The Orbbec SDK Wrappers provide a range of solutions to seamlessly integrate Orbbec 3D cameras into various development environments. These wrappers support multiple programming languages and frameworks, making it easier for developers to work with Orbbec devices in their preferred ecosystem. 

## 1. ROS

  Orbbec ROS SDK is a wrapper for Orbbec SDK that supports ROS Kinetic, Melodic, and Noetic distributions. It enables smooth integration of Orbbec 3D cameras into ROS projects. [https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS1](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS1).

## 2. ROS2

  Orbbec SDK ROS 2 is a wrapper for the Orbbec 3D camera that provides seamless integration with the ROS 2 environment. It supports ROS 2 Foxy, Humble, and Jazzy distributions. [https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS2](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS2).

## 3. Python

  This project provides Python bindings for the Orbbec SDK, allowing developers to interface with Orbbec devices in Python. [https://github.com/orbbec/pyorbbecsdk](https://github.com/orbbec/pyorbbecsdk).

## 4. K4A

  This is a wrapper  for the Orbbec SDK for  K4A, It allowing users to develop applications using the K4A API and access Orbbec cameras. Additionally, users can replace the native K4A library in their application with this library without any code changes.
